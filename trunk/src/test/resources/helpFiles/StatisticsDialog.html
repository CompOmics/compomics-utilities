        This dialog makes it straightforward to compare and visualize the numeric values 
        in a table. To the left simply select how to plot the data (xy plot, histogram 
        or density) and then select which column(s) to use as the input.
        <br><br>
        For xy plots one can 
        also select which values to use for the y axis, and which values to use as the size 
        and color of the data points.
        <br><br>
        If the size of the bubbles are too big or too small, change the bubble scaling factor 
        by clicking the blue "Size" label link.
        <br><br>
        For histograms the bin size is set automatically, but can be manually set by the user 
        in the "Bins" box.
        <br><br>
        If a logarithmic axis is desired this can be choosen under the "Logarithmic Axis" header. 
        Also note that the x and y axis can be swapped by clicking on one of the blue axis links.
        <br><br>
        As a default, dragging the mouse selects values in the xy plot. To zoom instead, 
        select the "Drag to Zoom" option. To clear the selection, simply click 
        in the plot where there are no data points. Clicking a selected data point will 
        unselect that data point.
        <br><br>
        Finally, the plot and selected values in the table can be exported to file from 
        the conextual options menus found in the upper right corners of the plot and 
        table.
