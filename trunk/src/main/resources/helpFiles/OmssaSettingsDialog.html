        <H2>OMSSA Advanced Settings</H2>

        <p align="justify">
            The Open Mass Spectrometry Search Engine (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15473683">OMSSA</a>) comes with many options for 
            fine tuning the search settings. Note that these settings aim to be used by advanced users only. It is highly recommended to carefully test any 
            changes from the default settings, to document them and report them in any publication/report.
            <br><br>
            Running OMSSA with the -help option will display all details of the available settings. If you are missing a parameter, please contact the developers.
        </p>
